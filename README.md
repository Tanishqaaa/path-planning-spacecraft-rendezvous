## **About The Project**  
### **Purpose**  
NewSpace involves activities relating to debris removal, avoidance and in-orbit repairs or service of satellites. This project preents a solution to the path planning problem during rendezvous. The problem of rendezvous in space is rather complicated with constraints on thrust, fuel, terminal position, terminal velocity, time and safety margins to prevent collision. Further, the solution needs to be optimized to achieve a time and cost-efficient solution.
To achieve this following criteria was kept in mind:

### **Key Challenges**  
- 🛠️ Maintaining a safe distance from debris  
- 🛠️ Minimizing fuel consumption via efficient thrust control  
- 🛠️ Ensuring precise positioning and velocity matching within terminal constraints
- 🛠️ Managing thrust and trajectory smoothness constraints.

### **Constraints**  
- 🔧 Thrust: Limited to ±0.01 km/s² per axis (max Thrust 10N)  
- 🌟 Debris Avoidance: Minimum safe distance of 50 meters (0.05 km)
- 🔧 Fuel Minimization: Minimize total delta V loss due to fuel consumption
- 🌟 Terminal State: Position within 1–5 meters and velocity within 0.22 m/s of the target
- 🔧 Smoothness: Limit abrupt changes in control inputs to avoid wear and tear
